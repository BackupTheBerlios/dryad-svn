RTLAD Dryad Readme

Thank you for giving Dryad a shot! We really appreciate it!

This file contains a few bits and pieces that you may find of interest.

./configure options of note:
--enable-paranoid-shutdown
	Because of how the core of dryad, the analysis thread, works it can't
	shutdown until it recieves a message to process. When we catch SIGINT
	and SIGTERM, we signal the networking threads that they need to end,
	and we wait for them to finish. We'd like to do the same for the core,
	but we can't be assured that it will get our signal until n timeperiods
	later. Basically, turn this option on if you want to have the cleanest of
	all possible shutdowns. If you just want Dryad to quit when you tell it to,
	ignore this options

--enable-emailplug
	This will cause the plugin sends emails to be built. If you enable this
	option you will need to have libesmtp installed as well.

--enable-pythonplug=/path/to/Python.h
	This will cause the python plugin to be built. You must specify the path
	to the instance of Python.h you wish to use. Generally, this is installed
	at $PREFIX/include/pythonVER/. The plugin has been tested with Python
	version 2.2 and 2.3.
